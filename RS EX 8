 Experiment No. 8
Aim:
To develop user profiles using various learning methods and compare their performance in recommending items.

Objective:
To evaluate machine learning techniques such as KMeans clustering and NMF for profiling users and improving recommendations.

ðŸ“š Theory
In personalized recommendation systems, understanding user behavior is crucial. This is done through user profiling, where we group or model users based on their preferences and interactions.

Two common approaches:

1. KMeans Clustering
Unsupervised learning algorithm.

Groups users based on their interaction patterns into k clusters.

Users in the same cluster are assumed to have similar preferences.

Evaluation Metrics:

Silhouette Score (higher is better),

Davies-Bouldin Index (lower is better),

Calinski-Harabasz Score (higher is better).

2. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
Factorizes the user-item matrix into two smaller matrices.

Learns latent features representing user interests and item characteristics.

Allows prediction of missing values (e.g., unrated books).

Evaluation Metrics:

MSE, RMSE, Reconstruction Error (lower is better).

PROGRAM CODE
# Load and clean dataset
ratings_df = pd.read_excel('Ratings.xlsx')
books_df = pd.read_excel('Books.xlsx')
users_df = pd.read_excel('Users.xlsx')

# Merge and pivot
merged_df = ratings_df.merge(users_df, on='User_id').merge(books_df, on='ISBN')
user_item_matrix = merged_df.pivot_table(index='User_id', columns='Title', values='Ratings', fill_value=0)

# KMeans
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(user_item_matrix)

# NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
nmf = NMF(n_components=5, init='random', random_state=42)
W = nmf.fit_transform(user_item_matrix)
H = nmf.components_

Output (Sample)
KMeans forms 5 user groups and calculates silhouette and other scores.
NMF reconstructs the matrix and allows recommendation prediction for unrated items.

 Conclusion
This experiment shows how user profiles can be developed using clustering (KMeans) and matrix factorization (NMF).
KMeans helps in grouping similar users, while NMF captures hidden patterns.
Combining both can lead to better personalization in recommendations.
