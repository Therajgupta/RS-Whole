Experiment No. 10
Aim:
To design and execute user studies to evaluate user satisfaction with recommendations.

Objective:
To gather and analyze user feedback to assess the effectiveness and quality of recommender systems.

ðŸ“š Theory
User studies are real-time evaluation techniques where users interact with the recommendation system, and feedback is collected to understand satisfaction, trust, and engagement.

Key areas assessed:

Relevance: Were the recommendations meaningful?

Diversity: Did the system show varied content?

Serendipity: Did it suggest something pleasantly surprising?

User Interface (UI): Was the system easy to use?

Methods used:

Surveys and feedback forms

Rating interfaces

A/B testing for comparing models

User studies complement offline evaluations by adding human perception to model effectiveness.

PROGRAM CODE;
# Experiment 10: User Study Feedback Collector
import statistics

# List to store feedback from users

    relevance = int(input("Rate the relevance of recommendations (1 to 5): "))
    diversity = int(input("Rate the diversity of recommendations (1 to 5): "))
    surprise = int(input("Rate the surprise factor (serendipity) (1 to 5): "))
    satisfaction = int(input("Rate overall satisfaction (1 to 5): "))
    comments = input("Any additional comments? ")

    feedback = {
        "name": name,

        "diversity": diversity,
        "surprise": surprise,
        "satisfaction": satisfaction,
        "comments": comments
    }

        print(f"- {fb['name']}: {fb['comments']}")

# Main Program Loop
while True:
    print("\n1. Submit Feedback")
    print("2. View Feedback Summary")
    print("3. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == '1':
        get_feedback()
    elif choice == '2':
        analyze_feedback()
    elif choice == '3':
        print("Thank you for participating in the study!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


ðŸ“¤ Output (Sample)
Feedback analysis:

Avg satisfaction score: 4.2/5

80% users found recommendations relevant

70% discovered new favorite items

âœ… Conclusion
User studies provide real-world validation for recommender systems.
They help assess user experience, perceived accuracy, and usability.
This feedback loop helps developers improve systems beyond just algorithmic performance.
