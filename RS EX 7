Experiment No. 7
Aim:
To analyze how different item representation methods impact the quality of recommendations.

Objective:
To compare collaborative, content-based, and hybrid representations for improved recommendations.

ðŸ“š Theory
Item representation affects how well a recommender system can understand and match user preferences. Common methods include:

Collaborative Filtering: Based on interaction history.

Content-Based Filtering: Based on metadata or descriptions.

Hybrid Methods: Combine both for improved accuracy.

Evaluation is done using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, NDCG, and RMSE. A hybrid system generally offers better performance by combining multiple perspectives on user preferences.

ðŸ’» Program Code (Summary)
Load book data (Books.xlsx, Ratings.xlsx).

Use TF-IDF for content-based similarity.

Use SVD from the surprise library for collaborative filtering.

Create a hybrid model by averaging both scores.

Evaluate with metrics (NDCG, F1, etc.).

PROGRAM CODE;

# Content-based
content_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)

# Collaborative
model = SVD()
model.fit(trainset)
predictions = model.test(testset)

# Hybrid
hybrid_scores = 0.5 * content_scores + 0.5 * collaborative_scores

Output (Sample)
Content-based: recommends books based on description.

Collaborative: recommends based on user similarity.

Hybrid: combines both and performs best.

âœ… Conclusion
Different item representation methods yield different outcomes. Hybrid systems provide the best performance by leveraging the strengths of both collaborative and content-based systems. 
Proper representation leads to better, more diverse recommendations.
